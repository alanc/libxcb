.SH NAME
xcb-examples \- manpage examples
.SH DESCRIPTION
Many of the XCB manpages contain example code. These examples intend to explain
how to use one particular part of XCB. They almost never represent a standalone
(or even useful) program - X11 programs are relatively involved and
thus beyond the scope of a manpage example.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

Every example assumes you have an \fIxcb_connection\fP and possibly other
variables at hand. For illustrating how \fIxcb_get_property\fP works, you need
the window of which you want to get the property, for example. To make it clear
that these variables are your responsibility, these examples consist of a
single function which takes the necessary variables as parameters.

.SH FLUSHING

Examples generally include the \fIxcb_flush\fP call where appropriate (for
example after setting a property). Therefore, including these functions and
calling them in your application should just work. However, you might get
better results when flushing outside of the function, depending on the
architecture of your program.

.SH COMPILATION

If an example does not compile (without warnings) when using \fI-std=c99\fP,
that is considered a documentation bug. Similarly, not handling errors or
leaking memory is also considered a documentation bug. Please inform us about
it on xcb@lists.freedesktop.org.

.SH CODING STYLE

Every example uses 4 spaces for indention.

Comments are in asterisks, like /* this */.

No line is longer than 80 characters (including indention).
